<p><strong><em>Exit, Pursued by a Bear</em></strong> gets its title from a famous stage direction in the Shakespeare play The Winter’s Tale. The moment when this direction occurs is the pivotal point in the play, when it ceases to become a tragedy and begins its progression to the happy ending usually reserved for comedies. I was drawn by this stage direction in two ways—one, because of its rather laconic and succinct format scattered among the usual flowery, Shakespearean language. However, more importantly, I was drawn in by the frightening image of a savage, extinct beast (wild bears were unknown to 17th century English audiences, as they had been extinct on the island since the 11th century) chasing me endlessly through a strange, Bohemian forest. This feral, violent chase is the primary inspiration for the piece.</p>
