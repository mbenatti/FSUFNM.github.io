<p>In <strong><em>Lion’s Breath</em></strong> I tried to convey a sensation of something very ambiguous—light, evasive and at the same time strong and menacing. Image of lion’s breath has a lot of connotations: from Middle Age legends to yoga poses. In my case there is an additional one: the idea for this title came to me from careful listening to the breathing of my new-born son whose name is Lev, which in Ukrainian means “lion.”</p>
