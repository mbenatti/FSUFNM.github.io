<p><strong><em>Into the Laughing Sea</em></strong> is a work for electric violin and live processing, specifically the program, Ableton Live, together with various other third party software plugin programs that work within Ableton on the Macintosh computer. The piece was inspired by a psychedelic drug experience, fortunately or unfortunately not my own, but described by a woman I heard on the radio who related her experience of seeing/hearing, “laughter turning into jewels falling from the sky.” I fell in love with that imagery. The piece was composed with the wonderful violinist, Ben Sung, in mind.</p>
