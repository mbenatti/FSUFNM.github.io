<p><strong><em>Five Bagatelles for Solo Piano</em></strong> were written as short reflections on scenes remembered from Australia. Each movement portrays a memory from the natural landscape that I observed in various parts of the country. <em>Tintinara</em> is a very small town on the lonely road between Melbourne and Adelaide. <em>Aqua Doubles</em> is a portrayal of two small river trout in the Atherton Tablelands of the Queensland rainforest region. <em>Whirly-whirly Dances</em> is a fast, dance-like movement portraying a dirt-devil spinning across the Australian desert. <em>Vicious Cinders Burning</em> is a short depiction of a bonfire in the Victorian high-country. <em>Lunar Blazes</em> is the portrayal of the light from a full moon over the Barossa Valley (South Australia) on an evening in 2005.</p>
