<p><strong><em>Excursus</em></strong> explores the methods in which modern television broadcasting attempts to provide different facets of human desire, thus propagating the continued use of the medium. The composition consists of three songs, each of which focuses on instinctive, physical, or mental desires. Current television programming attempts to satisfy these desires with sitcoms, pharmaceutical ads, and political slander, respectively. Instead of communicating this message traditionally via voice and piano, prerecorded media serves as accompaniment to the soprano. I make the distinction in the title that the work calls for “soprano and flexible media.” This word choice stems from the desire for the media to truly act as an accompaniment; therefore, I constructed a set of twenty advancing electronic tracks, each of which have head room to quickly crossfade into the following clip. While utilizing Max 6 in performance, an “accompanist” advances these tracks upon careful observation of the vocalist and score.</p>
