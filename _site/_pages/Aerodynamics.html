<p>Inspired by a trip to Disneyland, <strong><em>Aerodynamics</em></strong> describes an imaginary flight on an open-air glider. In 2005, I went on a new ride at the California Adventure theme park called “Soarin’ California,” during which I was suspended in the air with my legs dangling as if I were in a hang glider. I was immersed in imagery of landscapes that zoomed by as fans blew air at me to simulate incredible speed. I love high speeds and free flight, and <em>Aerodynamics</em> is my musical response to these visceral experiences. Musically, <em>Aerodynamics</em> is focused on the ebb and flow of fluid gestures, connected by a continuous stream of quickly repeated notes that represents the wind blowing at your face. Every line is echoed and mirrored so that a simple idea expands into a wash of sound. The listener may imagine taking flight throughout the piece, dipping and swooping as the shape of the music weaves its way from high to low and from small to large.</p>
