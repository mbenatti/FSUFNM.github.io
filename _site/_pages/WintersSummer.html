<p><strong><em>Winter’s Summer</em></strong> was written for Duke Sullivan in April 2014 and was inspired by Duke’s poem “Re-Blooming,” specifically the last phrase: “But, in the depth of winter I had an invincible summer…”. This piece emulates this by switching between a winter soundscape, still and quiet, and summer one, bright and active. The alto saxophone and fixed media are often intertwined with each other, as the fixed media was written almost entirely with filtered sounds and techniques on saxophone. The piece begins with a winter soundscape of melancholic phrases in the alto while being accompanied by a cold, empty wind in the fixed media. Several interruptions in the fixed media foreshadow the arrival of summer, which contrasts winter with fast, rhythmic, and jazz-like gestures. Summer gradually fades away and finally returns following the climax of the piece. However, at winter’s return the alto is no longer melancholic. Having had the opportunity to “bloom” in the brief summer of this piece, the alto waits once more for winter to fade away, and is given one final reminder of it in the fixed media before the winds of winter finally let go.</p>
