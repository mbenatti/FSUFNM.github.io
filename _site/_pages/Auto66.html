<p>My clarinet concerto <strong><em>Auto ‘66</em></strong> is inspired by three classic cars built in 1966. Each car has a different national origin, which allowed me to draw from the native music for each. First up is the Lamborghini Miura which moves from the opening “coloratura” cadenza that quickly leads into a breathless Italian tarantella. This is then morphed into an Afro-Cuban rhumba, a similarly energetic Latin dance in a compound meter. Since all cars should be fast, the typical adagio middle movement is replaced with a brief scherzo that depicts the British Mini Cooper S. Two works of Gustav Holst serve as source material: the intermezzo from his First Suite in E-flat and <em>Mercury</em> from <em>The Planets</em>. Finally, the Pontiac GTO hosts a wide array of American music from gospel to electronica with a special nod to clarinetist Artie Shaw. This work is dedicated to my father who taught me to love cars and bands, and to my wife who taught me to love the clarinet.</p>
