<p><strong><em>Very Angry Birds</em></strong> depicts a sound world of musical ideas based on imaginary bird calls. The imaginary bird calls become the musical gestures and materials that propel the dramatic narrative of the piece. The piano part serves as a rhythmic and structural foundation for the bird calls to emerge from the violin part, where all the bird calls appear. The piece is set in ABAʹ form: slow middle section and fast, propulsive outer sections. The violin has an incredible potential for mimicking various bird calls, and in this piece I push the violin to its technical extremes to elucidate the sonic palette with various combined techniques. Being a violinist myself, I experimented at great lengths to invent new expressive sonic gestures imitating the complexities and sophistication of bird calls. In the middle section I’m using a col legno swipe from the bridge to the fingerboard to create an eerie, continuous shimmer as an example, along with a variety of other techniques throughout the piece such as glissandos, ricochets, harmonics, rhythmic patterns, wood tapping, tremolos, sul ponticello, pizzicato, indeterminate pitches, etc.</p>
