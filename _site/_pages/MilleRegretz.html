<p><em>Mille regretz de vous abandonner<br />
Et d’eslonger vostre fache amoureuse,<br />
Jay si grand dueil et paine douloureuse,<br />
Quon me verra brief mes jours definer</em>.</p>

<p>A thousand regrets at deserting you<br />
and leaving behind your loving face,<br />
I feel so much sadness and such painful distress,<br />
that it seems to me my days will soon dwindle away. </p>

<p><strong><em>Mille Regretz</em></strong> is based on the chanson of the same name by Renaissance composer Josquin des Prez, a beautifully poignant secular polyphonic work in the Phrygian mode. The ghost of Josquin’s piece haunts this present work, lending its motivic material, harmonic landscapes, and polyphonic sensibilities to the “new” material. Josquin’s composition finally appears in its entirety at the conclusion of the work, emerging, as it were, as a timeless monument amidst the rubble of the modern.</p>
