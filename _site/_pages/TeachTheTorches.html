<p>The title of <strong><em>Teach the Torches to Burn Bright</em></strong> comes from Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet,” Act I, Scene V—the moment where the future lovers first lay eyes on one another: </p>

<p>ROMEO<br />
Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!<br />
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night<br />
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope’s ear,<br />
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.<br />
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows<br />
As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.<br />
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,<br />
And, touching hers, make blessèd my rude hand.<br />
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!<br />
For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.</p>

<p>The trio attempts to convey the yearning and exuberance of young love, without forgetting the drama’s tragic final outcome.</p>
