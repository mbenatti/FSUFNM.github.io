<p>Described as “a major talent and a deep thinker with a great ear” and “a distinctive voice in American music,” <strong>Lansing McLoskey</strong> has had his music performed in sixteen countries on six continents. He has won more than two-dozen national and international awards, including the prestigious Goddard Lieberson Fellowship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the International Joint Wind Quintet Project Competition, and most recently the 2014 Red Note Festival Composition Competition and an Aaron Copland Grant. Among his dozens of commissions are those from the FROMM Foundation, Meet the Composer, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Barlow Foundation, and Pew Charitable Trusts. Current commissions include works for ensemberlino vocale and Berlin PianoPercussion.

<p><strong><em>Specific Gravity: 2.72</em></strong> was commissioned by the newEar Ensemble (Kansas City) for their 20th Anniversary season. The term “Specific Gravity” refers to the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance. The substance with a Specific Gravity of 2.72 is emerald, the gem traditionally given on the 20th anniversary. </p>

<p>The two movements also draw their titles and characters from emerald: the first movement refers to the hardness of gems on the Mohs scale, emeralds being rated 7.5–8. In this movement crystalline and jagged punctuations are scattered around one long, lyrical melody (primarily in the violin). </p>

<p>“November Graveyard” refers to the poem by Sylvia Plath, which contains the lines “The scene stands stubborn: skinflint trees hoard last year’s leaves, won’t mourn, wear sackcloth, or turn to elegiac dryads, and dour grass guards the hard-hearted emerald of its grassiness, however the grandiloquent mind may scorn such poverty.” In this movement the music unfolds in three different tempi simultaneously, with an introspective, soulful yet not quite melancholic melody emerging as a saxophone solo.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I used the tradition of musical transliteration to embed the name “newEar” in the music, just as composers of the Renaissance would embed the name of a duke into a mass or motet commissioned for a coronation or other celebratory occasion. The musical transliteration of newEar is DECCEAD (for those who care: n = 14th letter = 2 (in mod-12) = D; e = E; w = double-u = ut/ut = C/C; a = A; r = re (in solfége) = D). This succession of pitches is the DNA of the entire piece, upon which all the melodies, chords, counterpoint, and harmony are based.</p>
