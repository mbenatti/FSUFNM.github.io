<p><strong><em>The Rush of the Brook Stills the Mind</em></strong> for multi-percussion and live, interactive electroacoustics takes its inspiration from a poem with the same title by Wally Swist. The percussionist’s virtuosic foray through Swist’s evocative work pairs acoustic and electroacoustic forces into a single entity. <em>The Rush of the Brook Stills the Mind</em> was commissioned by percussionist Scott Deal and is dedicated to him. </p>

<p>The trail flashes <br />
            
with sluices of snow melt.<br />
            
            
Silver-green undersides </p>

<p>of hemlock lift in the wind. <br />
            
A warbler’s electric call<br />
            
            
climbs all the way </p>

<p>up the mountain slope. <br />
            
That hidden waterfall<br />
            
            
we promised to see </p>

<p>this spring unrolls bolt after bolt<br />
            
of runoff that splashes<br />
            
            
veils of watery lace</p>

<p>over stones. The canopy<br />
            
creaks with pine siskins.<br />
            
            
Mist rises above snow. </p>

<p>The aloneness almost too much<br />
            
for one man. The surge<br />
            
            
of the brook crashes </p>

<p>around boulders; a sink hole<br />
            
swirls and dips. Ripples<br />
            
            
cascade in a basin </p>

<p>under deadfall to plunge <br />
            
into a froth of torrent.<br />
            
            
A nuthatch debugs </p>

<p>a fallen branch that rocks <br />
            
in the current; and a mayfly<br />
            
            
is blown above the spray. </p>
