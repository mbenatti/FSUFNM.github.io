<p><strong>Chris Arrell</strong> writes for throats, fingers, and oscillators. Praised for its nuance and unconventional beauty by <em>The Boston Music Intelligencer</em> and <em>The Atlanta Journal Constitution</em>, his music blurs boundaries between high and low art, color and harmony, line and pulse. In 2014, Arrell received the Ettelson Award for his work <em>Of Three Minds</em>, written for Tony Arnold and Jacob Greenberg of ICE. Additional awards are the Ossia Prize, the League of Composers/ISCM, the Martirano, MacDowell and ACA residencies, and a Fulbright-Hays. Commissions include Boston Musica Viva, MATA, Spivey Hall, Cornell, and the Fromm Foundation. Recent projects include <em>Oh, Popeye!</em> for the Bent Frequency Duo, who will complete a twelve-concert tour at Tage aktueller Musik (Nuremberg, Germany) and a portrait CD. Upcoming projects include a portrait concert at the Alte Schmiede in Vienna. Arrell’s music is available from Beauport, Electroshock Records, Parma Recordings, and Trevco Music.</p>

<p><strong><em>Of Three Minds</em></strong>, written for Tony Arnold and Jacob Greenberg, is a setting of five sections from Wallace Stevens’ poem “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a 
Blackbird” (1917). Inspired by Japanese haiku, each of the poem’s thirteen sections presents the image of a blackbird as the focal point for a concise study in vivid landscape and nuanced inflection. Scored for soprano, piano, and electronics, <em>Of Three Minds</em> enhances the traditional voice and piano duo with real time computer-generated signal processing (distortion, echo, simulated Doppler effects, and feedback) and prerecorded synthetic sounds modeled after spectral permutations of the sung voice. At times dominating the foreground and at other times adding subtle coloration, the electronics, like Stevens’ winged cynosure, serve to distinguish each song while unifying the cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Jennifer Bellor</strong> is a versatile composer who enjoys collaborating with classical and jazz musicians, singers, dancers, librettists, and visual artists. Her works have been presented by the Washington National Opera, the American Composers Orchestra, the Cuong Vu Trio, the Eastman Saxophone Project, the Buffalo Philharmonic, the Central Connecticut State University Wind Ensemble, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Wind Ensemble, the Eastman Wind Ensemble, the Eastman New Jazz Ensemble, and many others in the United States and abroad. She received a 2013 DownBeat award for her composition <em>Midnight Swim</em> for big band. Additionally, she was commissioned by the Washington National Opera’s American Opera Initiative to write a 20-minute opera, <em>Duffy’s Cut</em>, that was premiered at the Kennedy Center in November 2013. Bellor received a Ph.D. in Music Composition at the Eastman School of Music, a Master of Music degree in Composition at Syracuse University, and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music at Cornell University.</p>

<p><strong><em>Skylark Lullaby</em></strong> was written for the Eastman Saxophone Project under the direction of Chien Kwan Lin and was premiered at the 2014 North American Saxophone Alliance in March at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The main melody at the beginining of the piece is from a song I wrote in my opera <em>Duffy’s Cut</em> that was premiered at the Kennedy Center last November. I often like to create different versions of a piece using some of the same material, since I usually envision it in different ways. While I was writing the opera, I imagined reusing some of this thematic material to create a mediative and lyrical composition for saxophone choir.</p>

This year he will be enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University in the Advanced Certificate in Composition program.</p>

<p><strong><em>Et le nom murmura le nom de Sarah</em></strong> is an introspection of the saxophone’s production of sound. The sequence of notes constructed around the name Sarah (Eb-A-D-A-B) issues progressively from blowing into the instrument, like the wind whispering far away sounds. The structure of the piece is entirely based on the Lucas sequence, named for a nineteenth century French mathematician. This sequence, just like the Fibonacci sequence, is closely tied to the golden ratio <em>φ</em> (phi). From a simple breath, the sound texture progressively becomes more opulent until the climax, where it then starts to crumble little by little, returning to the initial breath, like a calm after an extremely violent storm.</p>

<p>In <strong><em>Lion’s Breath</em></strong> I tried to convey a sensation of something very ambiguous—light, evasive and at the same time strong and menacing. Image of lion’s breath has a lot of connotations: from Middle Age legends to yoga poses. In my case there is an additional one: the idea for this title came to me from careful listening to the breathing of my new-born son whose name is Lev, which in Ukrainian means “lion.”</p>

<p><strong>Michael Broder</strong> began composing at age 13, writing duets for fellow musicians and pieces for the wind bands at his middle school. Since then, his music has been performed by artists such as the Mana Saxophone Quartet, Duo Fujin, percussionist/composer Jamie Wind Whitmarsh, and the Eppes Quartet. Broder’s compositions encompass a variety of ensembles, including chamber winds and strings, concert band, and solo pieces for saxophone, trombone, guitar, piano, and percussion. He is a finalist for the Morton Gould award, a winner of Duo Fujin’s 2011 One-Day Composition Contest, and a two-time winner of the Arnold Salop Memorial Composition Prize. His studies include work with Leonard V. Ball, Clifton Callender, Adrian P. Childs, John Corina, and Ladislav Kubík. Broder is currently a doctoral candidate in Composition at Florida State University; he holds a Master’s in Composition from Florida State and a Bachelor’s in Composition from the University of Georgia.</p>

<p><strong><em>Musica derivata</em></strong> comprises four very different movements unified by a common creative strategy: in each, musical material is generated, in whole or in part, from an internal or existing source. <em>On/Off</em> is a tableau in which the baritone saxophone controls the other three, who rebel through combined effort. In sections, the repressed trio’s whispers mimic intervals in the opposing baritone’s melodies. <em>Liquid Choirs</em> employs a <em>soggetto cavato</em> system devised by Adrian P. Childs. The source text, from Dylan Thomas’ “Ballad of the Long-legged Bait,” includes the lines “And he who taught their lips to sing / Weeps like the risen sun among / The liquid choirs of his tribes.” For <em>Augury</em>, images of feathers were scattered across grid paper with lines corresponding to pitch and time. The resulting transcription is interpreted in flittering improvisations. <em>Unforced Errors</em> plays out as a series of canonic episodes, until a careless foul-up by the baritone derails the group, and they must rally to recover.</p>

<p>Composer <strong>Matthew Browne</strong> has recently received honors such as an ASCAP Morton Gould Young Composers award (2014), winner of the New England Philharmonic Call for Scores (2014), and a residency at the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra’s First Annual Composers Institute (2013). He is currently pursuing a D.M.A. from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Previous teachers include Michael Daugherty and Kristin Kuster.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exit, Pursued by a Bear</em></strong> gets its title from a famous stage direction in the Shakespeare play The Winter’s Tale. The moment when this direction occurs is the pivotal point in the play, when it ceases to become a tragedy and begins its progression to the happy ending usually reserved for comedies. I was drawn by this stage direction in two ways—one, because of its rather laconic and succinct format scattered among the usual flowery, Shakespearean language. However, more importantly, I was drawn in by the frightening image of a savage, extinct beast (wild bears were unknown to 17th century English audiences, as they had been extinct on the island since the 11th century) chasing me endlessly through a strange, Bohemian forest. This feral, violent chase is the primary inspiration for the piece.</p>

His compositions have been performed across the United States and abroad. Recent commissioners include the Aspen Music Festival, Tempus Continuum Ensemble, Marcel, and Diaspora Duo.</p>

<p>The title of <strong><em>Teach the Torches to Burn Bright</em></strong> comes from Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet,” Act I, Scene V—the moment where the future lovers first lay eyes on one another: </p>

<p>ROMEO<br />
Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!<br />
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night<br />
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope’s ear,<br />
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.<br />
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows<br />
As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.<br />
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,<br />
And, touching hers, make blessèd my rude hand.<br />
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!<br />
For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.</p>

<p>The trio attempts to convey the yearning and exuberance of young love, without forgetting the drama’s tragic final outcome.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>gegenschein</em></strong>, or counter shine, is a very feint brightening of the night sky centered on the point directly opposite the sun. It is a very indirect source of light—sunlight reflecting off of the very fine particles that make up interplanetary dust. This is an appropriate metaphor for the kind of sound world I have tried to create using a solo violin, a work consisting mostly of very fast arpeggiated and tremolo-like figures involving natural harmonics. Due to the speed of these figures, the harmonics only have time to partially sound, yielding a rapid succession of very feint overtones. The result is a fragile yet brilliant flickering of sound, mostly quiet and diffuse yet played with great intensity and aggression. My thanks to Piotr Szewczyk who commissioned and is premiering the work as part of his <em>Violin Futura</em> project.</p>

<p>Elliott Carter’s <strong><em>Night Fantasies</em></strong> is a piano piece of continuously changing moods, suggesting the fleeting thoughts and feelings that pass through the mind during a period of wakefulness at night. The quiet, nocturnal evocation with which it begins and returns occasionally, is suddenly broken by a flight series of short phrases that emerge and disappear. This episode is followed by many others of contrasting characters and lengths that sometimes break in abruptly and, at other times, develop smoothly out of what has gone before. The work culminates in a loud, obsessive, periodic repetition of an emphatic chord that, as it dies away, brings the work to its conclusion.</p>

<p>In this score, I wanted to capture the fanciful, changeable quality of our inner life at a time when it is not dominated by strong directive intentions or desires – to capture the poetic moodiness that, in an earlier romantic context, I enjoy in works of Robert Schumann like <em>Kreisleriana</em>, <em>Carnaval</em>, and <em>Davidsbündlertänze</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Szu-Yu Sarah Chen</strong> is a native of Taiwan, where she received her pre-college and collegiate musical training. She holds a Bachelor’s degree in Music Composition and Music Education from the National Taiwan Normal University, where she studied composition with Shing-Kwei Tzeng. At Cleveland State University, she earned her Master of Music degrees in both Piano Performance and Composition while studying piano under Angelin Chang and studying composition under Andrew Rindfleisch and Greg D’Alessio. She is currently a doctoral candidate in Music Composition at Florida State University where she studies composition with Ladislav Kubík. She teaches courses in Aural Skills, Music Theory, and Counterpoint at FSU.</p>

<p><strong><em>Variations on A Taiwanese Folk Song</em></strong> is comprised of a theme and nine variations, each dealing with a particular pattern or technique that could potentially pose a challenge for newcomers to the organ. The goal for this work was to write something that could serve to help pianists adjust to the organ while still maintaining a status of legitimate concert organ music. The theme is one of the oldest folk songs in southern Taiwan. In the work I attempt to manipulate the traditional Chinese pentatonic system with contemporary compositional techniques. The result is traditional Taiwanese music colored with a western paintbrush in a way that I hope demonstrates my own musical background and personality.</p>

Dr. David graduated with honors from the University of Georgia and completed his doctorate in Composition at Florida State University.</p>

<p>My clarinet concerto <strong><em>Auto ‘66</em></strong> is inspired by three classic cars built in 1966. Each car has a different national origin, which allowed me to draw from the native music for each. First up is the Lamborghini Miura which moves from the opening “coloratura” cadenza that quickly leads into a breathless Italian tarantella. This is then morphed into an Afro-Cuban rhumba, a similarly energetic Latin dance in a compound meter. Since all cars should be fast, the typical adagio middle movement is replaced with a brief scherzo that depicts the British Mini Cooper S. Two works of Gustav Holst serve as source material: the intermezzo from his First Suite in E-flat and <em>Mercury</em> from <em>The Planets</em>. Finally, the Pontiac GTO hosts a wide array of American music from gospel to electronica with a special nod to clarinetist Artie Shaw.

<p><strong><em>Until the end, my dear</em></strong><br />
Stravinsky, in his own words (1965 interview)— <br />
“When I composed the first part of the Sacre, Diaghilev invited me to Venice. And when I played this beginning of the Sacre to Diaghilev, he was a little bit surprised… He asked me only one thing, which was very offending, he asked me, ‘Will it last very long this way?’ And I said, ‘Until the end, my dear.’ And, he was silent because he understood that the answer was serious.” </p>

<p>Ballets Russes corps de ballet member, Dame Marie Rambert—<br />
“Hearing the way his music was being played, [Stravinsky] blazed up, pushed aside the fat German pianist, nicknamed “Kolossal” by Diaghilev, and proceeded to play twice as fast as we had been doing and twice as fast as we could possible dance. He stamped his feet on the floor and banged his fist on the piano and sang and shouted.”</p>

<p><strong>Don Freund</strong> is an internationally recognized composer with works ranging from solo, chamber, and orchestral music to pieces involving live performances with electronic instruments, music for dance, and large theatre works. He has been described as “ a composer thoughtful in approach and imaginative in style” (<em>The Washington Post</em>) whose music is “exciting, amusing, disturbing, beautiful, and always fascinating” (<em>Music and Musicians</em>, London). The recipient of numerous awards and commissions including two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and a Guggenheim fellowship, he has served as guest composer at a vast array of universities and music festivals and presented master classes throughout Europe, Asia, and South America. Freund is also active as a pianist, conductor, and lecturer. A professor of Composition at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music since 1992, his students from 40 years of teaching continue to win an impressive array of awards and recognitions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mixed Blood</em></strong> was commissioned by the Utah Arts Festival and premiered at the Festival in June 2013. But the Latin feel of the music has much more to do with the South American countries I visited during my sabbatical the previous fall than with Salt Lake City. In this piece the blood of Latin rhythms and a tango tune is mixed with sounds and structures of American contemporary art music. Introduced in the low register of the flute with bass clarinet as a soft response after a hard-edged introduction, the tango tune (nicknamed “tune-go”) is clearly the star of the piece. But there are a couple tangential excursions, and the “groove chant” (my nickname for the very first idea heard in the piece, built on rocking perfect fourths) returns several times, eventually as an extended run-on that builds to the final climactic reprise of the “tune-go” in octaves in the violin.</p>

<p><strong><em>Jie Ching</em></strong> is based on three selected Chinese Festivals—the Chinese New Year, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Qixi Festival (the Night of Sevens). The piece starts with a short introduction that derived from the main motive in the last section, then is followed by the section depicting the dangerous waves in the Dragon Boat Festival, continues with the celestial melodic ideas to depict the Zhi Nu and Niu Lang, and finally ends the piece with the celebrative Chinese New Year. As in nature, lives grow and cycle; continuous reproduction generates in an endless succession.</p>

<p>Composer-conductor <strong>Anthony Iannaccone</strong> studied at the Manhattan School of Music and the Eastman School of Music. His principal teachers were Vittorio Giannini, Aaron Copland, and David Diamond. During the 1960s he supported himself as part-time teacher (Manhattan School) and orchestral violinist, and he taught at Eastern Michigan University for 42 years. Many of his more than 50 published works have received awards and are performed by major orchestras and chamber ensembles in the U.S. and abroad. An active conductor of new music and standard orchestral repertory, his <em>WAITING FOR SUNRISE ON THE SOUND</em> received a Second Prize in the London Symphony Orchestra Masterprize competition from a field of 1151 works. Describing his music, the New Grove Dictionary states, “organic growth inspires music of great strength and formal clarity, as opening bars generate the textural and thematic contours that forge contrasting sections of reflection and cross-rhythmic dynamism.”</p>

<p>In 1933, Alban Berg wrote the following in a letter to his wife: “They’ve been dancing and stamping all through the night…the whole town… drowned in carnival din, masks and confetti. And on top of that the news of the Reichstag fire. DANCING ON A VOLCANO!” The Reichstag fire was a pivotal event in the Nazi takeover of Germany. Berg’s ominous letter became the inspiration for the music of <strong><em>Dancing on Vesuvius</em></strong>. Much of <em>Dancing on Vesuvius</em> could be described as the perilous journey of a disguised waltz theme, which only briefly reveals itself as a true waltz. The rhythmic foreground is filled with life-affirming energy that, in a few instances, yields to brief flashbacks of quiet nostalgia. However, the kinetic surface masks a dark, underlying, turbulent disturbance that ultimately erupts like Vesuvius and completely engulfs the lyric waltz elements that appeared as a kind of musical metaphor for a benevolent and civilized society.</p>

<p>Composer and pianist <strong>Jonathan Howard Katz</strong> is gaining increasing recognition for the unique immediacy and expressive depth of his music, which speaks to audiences and performers alike. Harnessing this intuitive grasp of communication combined with a rigorous technical command, he is building a diverse, yet highly individual, body of work that continues to grow. Katz’s music has been performed by the Cygnus Ensemble, Ensemble Pi, pianist Daria Rabotkina, violinist Ari Streisfeld, and many others. He has been commissioned by Concert Artists Guild and awarded the Robert Helps Prize and a Javits Fellowship. Through his non-profit Periapsis Music and Dance, he has worked with numerous dance companies and recently premiered a new work for dance at Symphony Space. Katz holds degrees in Piano Performance from Indiana University, NEC, and Northwestern. He studied composition with Jason Eckardt and Tania León, and piano with Ursula Oppens, Gabriel Chodos, and Edward Auer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trace</em></strong> was a collaboration with choreographer Hee Ra Yoo and dancer Leigh Schanfein. I saw a performance of an early version of the dance (with temp music) and was absolutely taken by Hee Ra’s concept and creation and by Leigh’s transformative performance as a character struggling to transcend her limited level of existence. We decided I’d create a score for the piece, and I watched the video over and over, inspired to try to enter this character’s world and create music that would tap into her thoughts and make her story even more vivid. Both music and dance adjusted to one another during the creative process, making for a true collaboration, and they continued to develop over the next several performances.</p>

<p><strong>Cody Kauhl</strong> is an acoustic/electronic composer that investigates the hidden musical potential of urban and rural noise pollution. His work has been performed at international and national festivals and conferences including the Center of Cypriot Composers and the Society for Electro Acoustic Music in the United States. Kauhl graduated in 2011 with a B.M. in Music Theory and Composition from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and recently completed his M.M. thesis in Music Composition at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He regularly collaborates with choreographers and visual artists and has had his compositions performed at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Electronic Music Midwest, Electroacoustic Barn Dance, Great Plains Regional Tuba and Euphonium Conference, 60×60, Kansas City Electronic Music and Arts Alliance, Kansas City Fringe Festival, Paragraph Gallery, and PLUG Projects.</p>

<p><strong><em>Excursus</em></strong> explores the methods in which modern television broadcasting attempts to provide different facets of human desire, thus propagating the continued use of the medium. The composition consists of three songs, each of which focuses on instinctive, physical, or mental desires. Current television programming attempts to satisfy these desires with sitcoms, pharmaceutical ads, and political slander, respectively. Instead of communicating this message traditionally via voice and piano, prerecorded media serves as accompaniment to the soprano. I make the distinction in the title that the work calls for “soprano and flexible media.” This word choice stems from the desire for the media to truly act as an accompaniment; therefore, I constructed a set of twenty advancing electronic tracks, each of which have head room to quickly crossfade into the following clip. While utilizing Max 6 in performance, an “accompanist” advances these tracks upon careful observation of the vocalist and score.</p>

<p><strong>Theodore</strong> (Ted) <strong>King-Smith</strong>’s music is a hybrid of vernacular and contemporary music, exploring the vast sonic space between an energetic drive and a surreal stillness. Hailing from the Hudson Valley of New York, where as a saxophonist he performed in a variety of ensembles ranging from improvisatory rock bands to jazz ensembles, King-Smith has degrees from the Hartt School of Music and Washington State University and is currently pursuing his D.M.A. in Composition at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Awards for his music include the 2012 Washington Idaho Symphony Young Artist Competition and the 2011 Sinfonian Saxes Composition Competition, as well as selected performances at the College Music Society Conferences in Vancouver, British Columbia and Knoxville, Tennessee. Notable performers and ensembles include the Saxophilia Saxophone Quartet, the Washington State University Wind Ensemble, the University of Tennessee Symphony Band, and others.</p>

<p><strong><em>Winter’s Summer</em></strong> was written for Duke Sullivan in April 2014 and was inspired by Duke’s poem “Re-Blooming,” specifically the last phrase: “But, in the depth of winter I had an invincible summer…”. This piece emulates this by switching between a winter soundscape, still and quiet, and summer one, bright and active. The alto saxophone and fixed media are often intertwined with each other, as the fixed media was written almost entirely with filtered sounds and techniques on saxophone. The piece begins with a winter soundscape of melancholic phrases in the alto while being accompanied by a cold, empty wind in the fixed media. Several interruptions in the fixed media foreshadow the arrival of summer, which contrasts winter with fast, rhythmic, and jazz-like gestures. Summer gradually fades away and finally returns following the climax of the piece. However, at winter’s return the alto is no longer melancholic. Having had the opportunity to “bloom” in the brief summer of this piece, the alto waits once more for winter to fade away, and is given one final reminder of it in the fixed media before the winds of winter finally let go.</p>

<p>Franz Kafka (1883–1924) holds a special place in the 20th century arts. His influence reaches across disciplines to inspire not only other writers and playwrights, but also visual artists and musicians. With an enigmatic style that “has yet to be emulated” (Shimon Sandbank), he points to “irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world” (Michel-André Bossy). Full of ambiguous idioms and metaphorical images, his language reveals an allegorical vision of the current and future world. </p>

<p>In the mid-1990s (especially between 1993 and 1997) Kubík turned his attention to the legacy of Franz Kafka. During this period he composed three compositions based on selections from Kafka’s texts (<em>The Way</em>, awarded The International Franz Kafka Prize in Prague; the original version of <em>River in Spring</em>; and <em>In Night</em> for various solo voices and chamber ensembles). Today’s performance is the premiere of a newly revised version of <strong><em>River in Spring</em></strong> (2014). The work contains three fragments from Kafka’s short story, “The Great Wall of China.”</p>

<p>–Text–</p>

<p>I can still remember quite well us standing as small children,<br />
Scarcely sure on our feet in our teacher’s garden<br />
And being ordered to build a sort of wall out of pebbles;<br />
And then the teacher, girding up his robe,<br />
Ran full tilt against the wall,<br />
Of course, knocking it down,<br />
And scolded us so terribly<br />
For the shoddiness of our work<br />
Then we ran weeping in all directions<br />
To our parents.<br />
A trivial incident<br />
But significant for the spirit of the time.</p>

<p>Long dead emperors are set on the throne in our villages<br />
And one that only lives in song<br />
Recently had a proclamation of his read out by the priest before the altar.<br />
Battles from our oldest history are newly fought now<br />
And a neighbor rushes in with a jubilant face to tell the news.<br />
Wives of emperors, too well fed on their silken cushions,<br />
Seduced from noble custom by wily courtiers,<br />
Swelling with ambitions, vehement in their greed,<br />
Uncontrollable in their lust,<br />
Practice their abominations ever anew.<br />
The more time has run, the more ghastly are the colours<br />
In which their deeds are painted<br />
And with a loud cry of woe, our village eventually hears<br />
How an empress drank her husband’s blood<br />
In long drafts,<br />
Thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>One can perhaps safely discuss it now.<br />
In those days many people, and among them the best,<br />
Had a secret maxim which ran:<br />
Try with all your might to comprehend the decrees of the high command<br />
But only up to a certain point, then cease further meditation.<br />
Let it occur to you like a river in spring.<br />
It rises until it grows mightier<br />
And nourishes more richly the soil<br />
On the long stretch of its banks,<br />
And maintains its own being until it enters the ocean<br />
And becomes a welcome ally.<br />
Thus far may you reflect on the decrees of the high command.<br />
But after that the river overflows its banks,<br />
Loses outline and shape,<br />
Slows down the speed of its current,<br />
Tries to ignore its destiny by forming little seas inlaid in the land,<br />
Damages the fields,<br />
And yet cannot maintain itself for long<br />
In its new expanse<br />
But must run back into its banks again<br />
Must even dry up wretchedly<br />
In the hot season which presently follows.<br />
Do not reflect so far on the decrees of the high command.<br />
Let it occur to you like a river in spring.</p>

<p>The trail flashes <br />
            
with sluices of snow melt.<br />
            
            
Silver-green undersides </p>

<p>of hemlock lift in the wind. <br />
            
A warbler’s electric call<br />
            
            
climbs all the way </p>

<p>up the mountain slope. <br />
            
That hidden waterfall<br />
            
            
we promised to see </p>

<p>this spring unrolls bolt after bolt<br />
            
of runoff that splashes<br />
            
            
veils of watery lace</p>

<p>over stones. The canopy<br />
            
creaks with pine siskins.<br />
            
            
Mist rises above snow. </p>

<p>The aloneness almost too much<br />
            
for one man. The surge<br />
            
            
of the brook crashes </p>

<p>around boulders; a sink hole<br />
            
swirls and dips. Ripples<br />
            
            
cascade in a basin </p>

<p>under deadfall to plunge <br />
            
into a froth of torrent.<br />
            
            
A nuthatch debugs </p>

<p>a fallen branch that rocks <br />
            
in the current; and a mayfly<br />
            
            
is blown above the spray. </p>

<p>Described as “a major talent and a deep thinker with a great ear” and “a distinctive voice in American music,” <strong>Lansing McLoskey</strong> has had his music performed in sixteen countries on six continents. He has won more than two-dozen national and international awards, including the prestigious Goddard Lieberson Fellowship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the International Joint Wind Quintet Project Competition, and most recently the 2014 Red Note Festival Composition Competition and an Aaron Copland Grant. Among his dozens of commissions are those from the FROMM Foundation, Meet the Composer, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Barlow Foundation, and Pew Charitable Trusts. Current commissions include works for ensemberlino vocale and Berlin PianoPercussion. Professor at the University of Miami, McLoskey’s music is released on Albany, Wergo Schallplatten, Capstone, Tantara, and Beauport Classics and published by Theodore Presser Co., American Composers Press, Subito Music, and Odhecaton Z Music.</p>

<p><strong><em>Specific Gravity: 2.72</em></strong> was commissioned by the newEar Ensemble (Kansas City) for their 20th Anniversary season. The term “Specific Gravity” refers to the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance. The substance with a Specific Gravity of 2.72 is emerald, the gem traditionally given on the 20th anniversary. </p>

<p>The two movements also draw their titles and characters from emerald: the first movement refers to the hardness of gems on the Mohs scale, emeralds being rated 7.5–8. In this movement crystalline and jagged punctuations are scattered around one long, lyrical melody (primarily in the violin). </p>

<p>“November Graveyard” refers to the poem by Sylvia Plath, which contains the lines “The scene stands stubborn: skinflint trees hoard last year’s leaves, won’t mourn, wear sackcloth, or turn to elegiac dryads, and dour grass guards the hard-hearted emerald of its grassiness, however the grandiloquent mind may scorn such poverty.” In this movement the music unfolds in three different tempi simultaneously, with an introspective, soulful yet not quite melancholic melody emerging as a saxophone solo.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I used the tradition of musical transliteration to embed the name “newEar” in the music, just as composers of the Renaissance would embed the name of a duke into a mass or motet commissioned for a coronation or other celebratory occasion. The musical transliteration of newEar is DECCEAD (for those who care: n = 14th letter = 2 (in mod-12) = D; e = E; w = double-u = ut/ut = C/C; a = A; r = re (in solfége) = D). This succession of pitches is the DNA of the entire piece, upon which all the melodies, chords, counterpoint, and harmony are based.</p>

<p><em>Mille regretz de vous abandonner<br />
Et d’eslonger vostre fache amoureuse,<br />
Jay si grand dueil et paine douloureuse,<br />
Quon me verra brief mes jours definer</em>.</p>

<p>A thousand regrets at deserting you<br />
and leaving behind your loving face,<br />
I feel so much sadness and such painful distress,<br />
that it seems to me my days will soon dwindle away. </p>

<p><strong><em>Mille Regretz</em></strong> is based on the chanson of the same name by Renaissance composer Josquin des Prez, a beautifully poignant secular polyphonic work in the Phrygian mode. The ghost of Josquin’s piece haunts this present work, lending its motivic material, harmonic landscapes, and polyphonic sensibilities to the “new” material. Josquin’s composition finally appears in its entirety at the conclusion of the work, emerging, as it were, as a timeless monument amidst the rubble of the modern.</p>

<p><strong><em>In Search of Planet X</em></strong> takes its name from Percival Lowell’s 1906 search for a planet beyond Neptune. Lowell used the term “Planet X” to represent this unknown force. While composing I was inspired not only by the remarkable quest upon which Lowell hinged his reputation, but also by the sense of possibility and discovery and wonder and mystery that such a search represented. I composed <em>In Search of Planet X</em> for musicians at the Music09 Festival at the Hindemith Foundation in Blonay, Switzerland: clarinetist Michael Maccaferri, violinist Aida Boiesan, and pianist Johanna Ballou.</p>

<p>In the field of materials science, the study of fracture mechanics makes a fundamental distinction between fractures that occur at different levels of tensile stress. In the case of brittle fracture, there is little or no apparent plastic deformation before failure occurs; in other words, cracks travel so fast that it is often impossible to tell when the material will break. <strong><em>Brittle Fracture</em></strong> attempts to depict this type of structural failure in musical terms. Inspired by modulation and temporal manipulation techniques commonly employed in pop music production, the piece is based on a simple four-note piano theme that is performed as if it were being processed through an echo unit. The piano’s resulting spectral content is selectively captured, extended, and transformed by the orchestral instruments, effectuating a long-range rhythmic, melodic, registral, articulative, and dynamic intensification. Throughout this textural crescendo, the music undergoes various types and degrees of stress that attempt to disrupt the constant musical flow. At the peak of the process the music finally buckles under its own weight, causing an abrupt rupture in the structure. A series of these fractures occurs, slicing between two contrasting musical surfaces until the inevitable and complete dissolution of their constituent materials. <em>Brittle Fracture</em> has been awarded a 2013 Sir Ernest MacMillan Award by the SOCAN Foundation and has been selected for the American Composers Orchestra’s 2014 Underwood New Music Readings.</p>

<p><strong><em>Very Angry Birds</em></strong> depicts a sound world of musical ideas based on imaginary bird calls. The imaginary bird calls become the musical gestures and materials that propel the dramatic narrative of the piece. The piano part serves as a rhythmic and structural foundation for the bird calls to emerge from the violin part, where all the bird calls appear. The piece is set in ABAʹ form: slow middle section and fast, propulsive outer sections. The violin has an incredible potential for mimicking various bird calls, and in this piece I push the violin to its technical extremes to elucidate the sonic palette with various combined techniques. Being a violinist myself, I experimented at great lengths to invent new expressive sonic gestures imitating the complexities and sophistication of bird calls. In the middle section I’m using a col legno swipe from the bridge to the fingerboard to create an eerie, continuous shimmer as an example, along with a variety of other techniques throughout the piece such as glissandos, ricochets, harmonics, rhythmic patterns, wood tapping, tremolos, sul ponticello, pizzicato, indeterminate pitches, etc.</p>

<p><strong><em>Five Bagatelles for Solo Piano</em></strong> were written as short reflections on scenes remembered from Australia. Each movement portrays a memory from the natural landscape that I observed in various parts of the country. <em>Tintinara</em> is a very small town on the lonely road between Melbourne and Adelaide. <em>Aqua Doubles</em> is a portrayal of two small river trout in the Atherton Tablelands of the Queensland rainforest region. <em>Whirly-whirly Dances</em> is a fast, dance-like movement portraying a dirt-devil spinning across the Australian desert. <em>Vicious Cinders Burning</em> is a short depiction of a bonfire in the Victorian high-country. <em>Lunar Blazes</em> is the portrayal of the light from a full moon over the Barossa Valley (South Australia) on an evening in 2005.</p>

<p><strong><em>Into the Laughing Sea</em></strong> is a work for electric violin and live processing, specifically the program, Ableton Live, together with various other third party software plugin programs that work within Ableton on the Macintosh computer. The piece was inspired by a psychedelic drug experience, fortunately or unfortunately not my own, but described by a woman I heard on the radio who related her experience of seeing/hearing, “laughter turning into jewels falling from the sky.” I fell in love with that imagery. The piece was composed with the wonderful violinist, Ben Sung, in mind.</p>

<p>Inspired by a trip to Disneyland, <strong><em>Aerodynamics</em></strong> describes an imaginary flight on an open-air glider. In 2005, I went on a new ride at the California Adventure theme park called “Soarin’ California,” during which I was suspended in the air with my legs dangling as if I were in a hang glider. I was immersed in imagery of landscapes that zoomed by as fans blew air at me to simulate incredible speed. I love high speeds and free flight, and <em>Aerodynamics</em> is my musical response to these visceral experiences. Musically, <em>Aerodynamics</em> is focused on the ebb and flow of fluid gestures, connected by a continuous stream of quickly repeated notes that represents the wind blowing at your face. Every line is echoed and mirrored so that a simple idea expands into a wash of sound. The listener may imagine taking flight throughout the piece, dipping and swooping as the shape of the music weaves its way from high to low and from small to large.</p>
