Composer and pianist **Jonathan Howard Katz** is gaining increasing recognition for the unique immediacy and expressive depth of his music, which speaks to audiences and performers alike. Harnessing this intuitive grasp of communication combined with a rigorous technical command, he is building a diverse, yet highly individual, body of work that continues to grow. Katz's music has been performed by the Cygnus Ensemble, Ensemble Pi, pianist Daria Rabotkina, violinist Ari Streisfeld, and many others. He has been commissioned by Concert Artists Guild and awarded the Robert Helps Prize and a Javits Fellowship. Through his non-profit Periapsis Music and Dance, he has worked with numerous dance companies and recently premiered a new work for dance at Symphony Space. Katz holds degrees in Piano Performance from Indiana University, NEC, and Northwestern. He studied composition with Jason Eckardt and Tania León, and piano with Ursula Oppens, Gabriel Chodos, and Edward Auer.

**_Trace_** was a collaboration with choreographer Hee Ra Yoo and dancer Leigh Schanfein. I saw a performance of an early version of the dance (with temp music) and was absolutely taken by Hee Ra’s concept and creation and by Leigh’s transformative performance as a character struggling to transcend her limited level of existence. We decided I'd create a score for the piece, and I watched the video over and over, inspired to try to enter this character’s world and create music that would tap into her thoughts and make her story even more vivid. Both music and dance adjusted to one another during the creative process, making for a true collaboration, and they continued to develop over the next several performances.
