**_Skylark Lullaby_** was written for the Eastman Saxophone Project under the direction of Chien Kwan Lin and was premiered at the 2014 North American Saxophone Alliance in March at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The main melody at the beginining of the piece is from a song I wrote in my opera *Duffy's Cut* that was premiered at the Kennedy Center last November. I often like to create different versions of a piece using some of the same material, since I usually envision it in different ways. While I was writing the opera, I imagined reusing some of this thematic material to create a mediative and lyrical composition for saxophone choir.
