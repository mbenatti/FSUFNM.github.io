The title of **_Teach the Torches to Burn Bright_** comes from Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," Act I, Scene V—the moment where the future lovers first lay eyes on one another: 

ROMEO  
Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!  
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night  
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope’s ear,  
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.  
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows  
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.  
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,  
And, touching hers, make blessèd my rude hand.  
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!  
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

The trio attempts to convey the yearning and exuberance of young love, without forgetting the drama's tragic final outcome.
