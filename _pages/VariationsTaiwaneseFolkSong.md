**_Variations on A Taiwanese Folk Song_** is comprised of a theme and nine variations, each dealing with a particular pattern or technique that could potentially pose a challenge for newcomers to the organ. The goal for this work was to write something that could serve to help pianists adjust to the organ while still maintaining a status of legitimate concert organ music. The theme is one of the oldest folk songs in southern Taiwan. In the work I attempt to manipulate the traditional Chinese pentatonic system with contemporary compositional techniques. The result is traditional Taiwanese music colored with a western paintbrush in a way that I hope demonstrates my own musical background and personality.
