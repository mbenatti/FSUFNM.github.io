**_In Search of Planet X_** takes its name from Percival Lowell's 1906 search for a planet beyond Neptune. Lowell used the term "Planet X" to represent this unknown force. While composing I was inspired not only by the remarkable quest upon which Lowell hinged his reputation, but also by the sense of possibility and discovery and wonder and mystery that such a search represented. I composed _In Search of Planet X_ for musicians at the Music09 Festival at the Hindemith Foundation in Blonay, Switzerland: clarinetist Michael Maccaferri, violinist Aida Boiesan, and pianist Johanna Ballou.
