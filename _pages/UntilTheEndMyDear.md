**_Until the end, my dear_**  
Stravinsky, in his own words (1965 interview)—   
"When I composed the first part of the Sacre, Diaghilev invited me to Venice. And when I played this beginning of the Sacre to Diaghilev, he was a little bit surprised… He asked me only one thing, which was very offending, he asked me, ‘Will it last very long this way?’ And I said, ‘Until the end, my dear.’ And, he was silent because he understood that the answer was serious." 

Ballets Russes corps de ballet member, Dame Marie Rambert—  
"Hearing the way his music was being played, [Stravinsky] blazed up, pushed aside the fat German pianist, nicknamed "Kolossal" by Diaghilev, and proceeded to play twice as fast as we had been doing and twice as fast as we could possible dance. He stamped his feet on the floor and banged his fist on the piano and sang and shouted."
