**Anthony** (A.J.) **Stillabower** is a recent graduate of Florida State University, where he was under the direction of Ladislav Kubik. He has been the recipient of multiple gracious awards from the Tallahassee Symphony Guild, is a 2014 ASCAP finalist, and has been invited to study at the exclusive Czech-American Summer Music Institute (CASMI). These recognitions have led to a recent commission from the Mana Saxophone Quartet, scheduled to be performed in late 2014. Stillabower will be attending the Juilliard School in the fall, under a C. & H. Lewine Scholarship to study with Professor Christopher Rouse.
