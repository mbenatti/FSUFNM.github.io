**_Jie Ching_** is based on three selected Chinese Festivals—the Chinese New Year, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Qixi Festival (the Night of Sevens). The piece starts with a short introduction that derived from the main motive in the last section, then is followed by the section depicting the dangerous waves in the Dragon Boat Festival, continues with the celestial melodic ideas to depict the Zhi Nu and Niu Lang, and finally ends the piece with the celebrative Chinese New Year. As in nature, lives grow and cycle; continuous reproduction generates in an endless succession.
