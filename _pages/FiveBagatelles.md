**_Five Bagatelles for Solo Piano_** were written as short reflections on scenes remembered from Australia. Each movement portrays a memory from the natural landscape that I observed in various parts of the country. *Tintinara* is a very small town on the lonely road between Melbourne and Adelaide. *Aqua Doubles* is a portrayal of two small river trout in the Atherton Tablelands of the Queensland rainforest region. *Whirly-whirly Dances* is a fast, dance-like movement portraying a dirt-devil spinning across the Australian desert. *Vicious Cinders Burning* is a short depiction of a bonfire in the Victorian high-country. *Lunar Blazes* is the portrayal of the light from a full moon over the Barossa Valley (South Australia) on an evening in 2005.
