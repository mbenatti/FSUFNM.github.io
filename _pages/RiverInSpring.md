Franz Kafka (1883–1924) holds a special place in the 20th century arts. His influence reaches across disciplines to inspire not only other writers and playwrights, but also visual artists and musicians. With an enigmatic style that “has yet to be emulated” (Shimon Sandbank), he points to “irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world” (Michel-André Bossy). Full of ambiguous idioms and metaphorical images, his language reveals an allegorical vision of the current and future world. 

In the mid-1990s (especially between 1993 and 1997) Kubík turned his attention to the legacy of Franz Kafka. During this period he composed three compositions based on selections from Kafka’s texts (_The Way_, awarded The International Franz Kafka Prize in Prague; the original version of _River in Spring_; and _In Night_ for various solo voices and chamber ensembles). Today’s performance is the premiere of a newly revised version of **_River in Spring_** (2014). The work contains three fragments from Kafka’s short story, "The Great Wall of China."

–Text–

I can still remember quite well us standing as small children,  
Scarcely sure on our feet in our teacher's garden  
And being ordered to build a sort of wall out of pebbles;  
And then the teacher, girding up his robe,  
Ran full tilt against the wall,  
Of course, knocking it down,  
And scolded us so terribly  
For the shoddiness of our work  
Then we ran weeping in all directions  
To our parents.  
A trivial incident  
But significant for the spirit of the time.

Long dead emperors are set on the throne in our villages  
And one that only lives in song  
Recently had a proclamation of his read out by the priest before the altar.  
Battles from our oldest history are newly fought now  
And a neighbor rushes in with a jubilant face to tell the news.  
Wives of emperors, too well fed on their silken cushions,  
Seduced from noble custom by wily courtiers,  
Swelling with ambitions, vehement in their greed,  
Uncontrollable in their lust,  
Practice their abominations ever anew.  
The more time has run, the more ghastly are the colours  
In which their deeds are painted  
And with a loud cry of woe, our village eventually hears  
How an empress drank her husband's blood  
In long drafts,  
Thousands of years ago.

One can perhaps safely discuss it now.  
In those days many people, and among them the best,  
Had a secret maxim which ran:  
Try with all your might to comprehend the decrees of the high command  
But only up to a certain point, then cease further meditation.  
Let it occur to you like a river in spring.  
It rises until it grows mightier  
And nourishes more richly the soil  
On the long stretch of its banks,  
And maintains its own being until it enters the ocean  
And becomes a welcome ally.  
Thus far may you reflect on the decrees of the high command.  
But after that the river overflows its banks,  
Loses outline and shape,  
Slows down the speed of its current,  
Tries to ignore its destiny by forming little seas inlaid in the land,  
Damages the fields,  
And yet cannot maintain itself for long  
In its new expanse  
But must run back into its banks again  
Must even dry up wretchedly  
In the hot season which presently follows.  
Do not reflect so far on the decrees of the high command.  
Let it occur to you like a river in spring.
