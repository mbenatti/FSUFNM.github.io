**Chris Arrell** writes for throats, fingers, and oscillators. Praised for its nuance and unconventional beauty by *The Boston Music Intelligencer* and *The Atlanta Journal Constitution*, his music blurs boundaries between high and low art, color and harmony, line and pulse. In 2014, Arrell received the Ettelson Award for his work *Of Three Minds*, written for Tony Arnold and Jacob Greenberg of ICE. Additional awards are the Ossia Prize, the League of Composers/ISCM, the Martirano, MacDowell and ACA residencies, and a Fulbright-Hays. Commissions include Boston Musica Viva, MATA, Spivey Hall, Cornell, and the Fromm Foundation. Recent projects include *Oh, Popeye!* for the Bent Frequency Duo, who will complete a twelve-concert tour at Tage aktueller Musik (Nuremberg, Germany) and a portrait CD. Upcoming projects include a portrait concert at the Alte Schmiede in Vienna. Arrell's music is available from Beauport, Electroshock Records, Parma Recordings, and Trevco Music.

**_Of Three Minds_**, written for Tony Arnold and Jacob Greenberg, is a setting of five sections from Wallace Stevens’ poem “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a 
Blackbird” (1917). Inspired by Japanese haiku, each of the poem’s thirteen sections presents the image of a blackbird as the focal point for a concise study in vivid landscape and nuanced inflection. Scored for soprano, piano, and electronics, *Of Three Minds* enhances the traditional voice and piano duo with real time computer-generated signal processing (distortion, echo, simulated Doppler effects, and feedback) and prerecorded synthetic sounds modeled after spectral permutations of the sung voice. At times dominating the foreground and at other times adding subtle coloration, the electronics, like Stevens’ winged cynosure, serve to distinguish each song while unifying the cycle.
