Using recorded and manipulated environmental sounds, **_Concerto for Violin, Guitar, and Bear Mountain_** probes the relationships between man, environment, and technology and explores the possibilities for these entities to exist in concert. The four connected movements bear some resemblance to concerto practices of previous eras and include prerecorded violin and guitar sounds provided by Duo46, for whom this piece was written.
