**_Mixed Blood_** was commissioned by the Utah Arts Festival and premiered at the Festival in June 2013. But the Latin feel of the music has much more to do with the South American countries I visited during my sabbatical the previous fall than with Salt Lake City. In this piece the blood of Latin rhythms and a tango tune is mixed with sounds and structures of American contemporary art music. Introduced in the low register of the flute with bass clarinet as a soft response after a hard-edged introduction, the tango tune (nicknamed “tune-go”) is clearly the star of the piece. But there are a couple tangential excursions, and the “groove chant” (my nickname for the very first idea heard in the piece, built on rocking perfect fourths) returns several times, eventually as an extended run-on that builds to the final climactic reprise of the “tune-go” in octaves in the violin.

**_The Rush of the Brook Stills the Mind_** for multi-percussion and live, interactive electroacoustics takes its inspiration from a poem with the same title by Wally Swist. The percussionist’s virtuosic foray through Swist’s evocative work pairs acoustic and electroacoustic forces into a single entity. *The Rush of the Brook Stills the Mind* was commissioned by percussionist Scott Deal and is dedicated to him. 

The trail flashes   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with sluices of snow melt.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Silver-green undersides 

of hemlock lift in the wind.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A warbler’s electric call  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
climbs all the way 

up the mountain slope.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That hidden waterfall  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
we promised to see 


this spring unrolls bolt after bolt  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of runoff that splashes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
veils of watery lace

over stones. The canopy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
creaks with pine siskins.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mist rises above snow. 

The aloneness almost too much  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
for one man. The surge  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the brook crashes 

around boulders; a sink hole  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
swirls and dips. Ripples  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cascade in a basin 

under deadfall to plunge   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
into a froth of torrent.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A nuthatch debugs 

a fallen branch that rocks   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the current; and a mayfly  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is blown above the spray.

**_Specific Gravity: 2.72_** was commissioned by the newEar Ensemble (Kansas City) for their 20th Anniversary season. The term “Specific Gravity” refers to the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance. The substance with a Specific Gravity of 2.72 is emerald, the gem traditionally given on the 20th anniversary. 

The two movements also draw their titles and characters from emerald: the first movement refers to the hardness of gems on the Mohs scale, emeralds being rated 7.5–8. In this movement crystalline and jagged punctuations are scattered around one long, lyrical melody (primarily in the violin). 

“November Graveyard” refers to the poem by Sylvia Plath, which contains the lines “The scene stands stubborn: skinflint trees hoard last year's leaves, won't mourn, wear sackcloth, or turn to elegiac dryads, and dour grass guards the hard-hearted emerald of its grassiness, however the grandiloquent mind may scorn such poverty.” In this movement the music unfolds in three different tempi simultaneously, with an introspective, soulful yet not quite melancholic melody emerging as a saxophone solo.

Furthermore, I used the tradition of musical transliteration to embed the name “newEar” in the music, just as composers of the Renaissance would embed the name of a duke into a mass or motet commissioned for a coronation or other celebratory occasion. The musical transliteration of newEar is DECCEAD (for those who care: n = 14th letter = 2 (in mod-12) = D; e = E; w = double-u = ut/ut = C/C; a = A; r = re (in solfége) = D). This succession of pitches is the DNA of the entire piece, upon which all the melodies, chords, counterpoint, and harmony are based.

**_Skylark Lullaby_** was written for the Eastman Saxophone Project under the direction of Chien Kwan Lin and was premiered at the 2014 North American Saxophone Alliance in March at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The main melody at the beginining of the piece is from a song I wrote in my opera *Duffy's Cut* that was premiered at the Kennedy Center last November. I often like to create different versions of a piece using some of the same material, since I usually envision it in different ways. While I was writing the opera, I imagined reusing some of this thematic material to create a mediative and lyrical composition for saxophone choir.

*Mille regretz de vous abandonner  
Et d'eslonger vostre fache amoureuse,  
Jay si grand dueil et paine douloureuse,  
Quon me verra brief mes jours definer*.

A thousand regrets at deserting you  
and leaving behind your loving face,  
I feel so much sadness and such painful distress,  
that it seems to me my days will soon dwindle away. 

**_Mille Regretz_** is based on the chanson of the same name by Renaissance composer Josquin des Prez, a beautifully poignant secular polyphonic work in the Phrygian mode. The ghost of Josquin's piece haunts this present work, lending its motivic material, harmonic landscapes, and polyphonic sensibilities to the “new” material. Josquin’s composition finally appears in its entirety at the conclusion of the work, emerging, as it were, as a timeless monument amidst the rubble of the modern.

**_Fury_** is the first of a planned group of short character pieces for solo piano.

The title of **_Teach the Torches to Burn Bright_** comes from Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," Act I, Scene V—the moment where the future lovers first lay eyes on one another: 

ROMEO  
Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!  
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night  
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope’s ear,  
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.  
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows  
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.  
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,  
And, touching hers, make blessèd my rude hand.  
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!  
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night. 

The trio attempts to convey the yearning and exuberance of young love, without forgetting the drama's tragic final outcome.

**_Until the end, my dear_**

Stravinsky, in his own words (1965 interview)—   
"When I composed the first part of the Sacre, Diaghilev invited me to Venice. And when I played this beginning of the Sacre to Diaghilev, he was a little bit surprised… He asked me only one thing, which was very offending, he asked me, ‘Will it last very long this way?’ And I said, ‘Until the end, my dear.’ And, he was silent because he understood that the answer was serious." 

Ballets Russes corps de ballet member, Dame Marie Rambert—  
"Hearing the way his music was being played, [Stravinsky] blazed up, pushed aside the fat German pianist, nicknamed "Kolossal" by Diaghilev, and proceeded to play twice as fast as we had been doing and twice as fast as we could possible dance. He stamped his feet on the floor and banged his fist on the piano and sang and shouted."

**_Musica derivata_** comprises four very different movements unified by a common creative strategy: in each, musical material is generated, in whole or in part, from an internal or existing source. *On/Off* is a tableau in which the baritone saxophone controls the other three, who rebel through combined effort. In sections, the repressed trio’s whispers mimic intervals in the opposing baritone’s melodies. *Liquid Choirs* employs a *soggetto cavato* system devised by Adrian P. Childs. The source text, from Dylan Thomas' “Ballad of the Long-legged Bait,” includes the lines "And he who taught their lips to sing / Weeps like the risen sun among / The liquid choirs of his tribes." For *Augury*, images of feathers were scattered across grid paper with lines corresponding to pitch and time. The resulting transcription is interpreted in flittering improvisations. *Unforced Errors* plays out as a series of canonic episodes, until a careless foul-up by the baritone derails the group, and they must rally to recover.

**_Five Bagatelles for Solo Piano_** were written as short reflections on scenes remembered from Australia. Each movement portrays a memory from the natural landscape that I observed in various parts of the country. *Tintinara* is a very small town on the lonely road between Melbourne and Adelaide. *Aqua Doubles* is a portrayal of two small river trout in the Atherton Tablelands of the Queensland rainforest region. *Whirly-whirly Dances* is a fast, dance-like movement portraying a dirt-devil spinning across the Australian desert. *Vicious Cinders Burning* is a short depiction of a bonfire in the Victorian high-country. *Lunar Blazes* is the portrayal of the light from a full moon over the Barossa Valley (South Australia) on an evening in 2005.

**_Exit, Pursued by a Bear_** gets its title from a famous stage direction in the Shakespeare play The Winter’s Tale. The moment when this direction occurs is the pivotal point in the play, when it ceases to become a tragedy and begins its progression to the happy ending usually reserved for comedies. I was drawn by this stage direction in two ways—one, because of its rather laconic and succinct format scattered among the usual flowery, Shakespearean language. However, more importantly, I was drawn in by the frightening image of a savage, extinct beast (wild bears were unknown to 17th century English audiences, as they had been extinct on the island since the 11th century) chasing me endlessly through a strange, Bohemian forest. This feral, violent chase is the primary inspiration for the piece.

**_Trace_**e was a collaboration with choreographer Hee Ra Yoo and dancer Leigh Schanfein. I saw a performance of an early version of the dance (with temp music) and was absolutely taken by Hee Ra’s concept and creation and by Leigh’s transformative performance as a character struggling to transcend her limited level of existence. We decided I'd create a score for the piece, and I watched the video over and over, inspired to try to enter this character’s world and create music that would tap into her thoughts and make her story even more vivid. Both music and dance adjusted to one another during the creative process, making for a true collaboration, and they continued to develop over the next several performances.

**_Of Three Minds_**, written for Tony Arnold and Jacob Greenberg, is a setting of five sections from Wallace Stevens’ poem “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a 
Blackbird” (1917). Inspired by Japanese haiku, each of the poem’s thirteen sections presents the image of a blackbird as the focal point for a concise study in vivid landscape and nuanced inflection. Scored for soprano, piano, and electronics, *Of Three Minds* enhances the traditional voice and piano duo with real time computer-generated signal processing (distortion, echo, simulated Doppler effects, and feedback) and prerecorded synthetic sounds modeled after spectral permutations of the sung voice. At times dominating the foreground and at other times adding subtle coloration, the electronics, like Stevens’ winged cynosure, serve to distinguish each song while unifying the cycle.

Using recorded and manipulated environmental sounds, **_Concerto for Violin, Guitar, and Bear Mountain_** probes the relationships between man, environment, and technology and explores the possibilities for these entities to exist in concert. The four connected movements bear some resemblance to concerto practices of previous eras and include prerecorded violin and guitar sounds provided by Duo46, for whom this piece was written.

**_Excursus_** explores the methods in which modern television broadcasting attempts to provide different facets of human desire, thus propagating the continued use of the medium. The composition consists of three songs, each of which focuses on instinctive, physical, or mental desires. Current television programming attempts to satisfy these desires with sitcoms, pharmaceutical ads, and political slander, respectively. Instead of communicating this message traditionally via voice and piano, prerecorded media serves as accompaniment to the soprano. I make the distinction in the title that the work calls for “soprano and flexible media.” This word choice stems from the desire for the media to truly act as an accompaniment; therefore, I constructed a set of twenty advancing electronic tracks, each of which have head room to quickly crossfade into the following clip. While utilizing Max 6 in performance, an “accompanist” advances these tracks upon careful observation of the vocalist and score.

**_Winter's Summer_** was written for Duke Sullivan in April 2014 and was inspired by Duke's poem “Re-Blooming,” specifically the last phrase: "But, in the depth of winter I had an invincible summer...". This piece emulates this by switching between a winter soundscape, still and quiet, and summer one, bright and active. The alto saxophone and fixed media are often intertwined with each other, as the fixed media was written almost entirely with filtered sounds and techniques on saxophone. The piece begins with a winter soundscape of melancholic phrases in the alto while being accompanied by a cold, empty wind in the fixed media. Several interruptions in the fixed media foreshadow the arrival of summer, which contrasts winter with fast, rhythmic, and jazz-like gestures. Summer gradually fades away and finally returns following the climax of the piece. However, at winter’s return the alto is no longer melancholic. Having had the opportunity to “bloom” in the brief summer of this piece, the alto waits once more for winter to fade away, and is given one final reminder of it in the fixed media before the winds of winter finally let go.

**_Very Angry Birds_** depicts a sound world of musical ideas based on imaginary bird calls. The imaginary bird calls become the musical gestures and materials that propel the dramatic narrative of the piece. The piano part serves as a rhythmic and structural foundation for the bird calls to emerge from the violin part, where all the bird calls appear. The piece is set in ABAʹ form: slow middle section and fast, propulsive outer sections. The violin has an incredible potential for mimicking various bird calls, and in this piece I push the violin to its technical extremes to elucidate the sonic palette with various combined techniques. Being a violinist myself, I experimented at great lengths to invent new expressive sonic gestures imitating the complexities and sophistication of bird calls. In the middle section I’m using a col legno swipe from the bridge to the fingerboard to create an eerie, continuous shimmer as an example, along with a variety of other techniques throughout the piece such as glissandos, ricochets, harmonics, rhythmic patterns, wood tapping, tremolos, sul ponticello, pizzicato, indeterminate pitches, etc.

**_Emerald Meditations_** was inspired by a recent trip to Thailand in which I visited the Emerald Buddha, a legendary statue in the Wat Phra Keow temple in Bangkok.

In the field of materials science, the study of fracture mechanics makes a fundamental distinction between fractures that occur at different levels of tensile stress. In the case of brittle fracture, there is little or no apparent plastic deformation before failure occurs; in other words, cracks travel so fast that it is often impossible to tell when the material will break. **_Brittle Fracture_** attempts to depict this type of structural failure in musical terms. Inspired by modulation and temporal manipulation techniques commonly employed in pop music production, the piece is based on a simple four-note piano theme that is performed as if it were being processed through an echo unit. The piano’s resulting spectral content is selectively captured, extended, and transformed by the orchestral instruments, effectuating a long-range rhythmic, melodic, registral, articulative, and dynamic intensification. Throughout this textural crescendo, the music undergoes various types and degrees of stress that attempt to disrupt the constant musical flow. At the peak of the process the music finally buckles under its own weight, causing an abrupt rupture in the structure. A series of these fractures occurs, slicing between two contrasting musical surfaces until the inevitable and complete dissolution of their constituent materials. *Brittle Fracture* has been awarded a 2013 Sir Ernest MacMillan Award by the SOCAN Foundation and has been selected for the American Composers Orchestra's 2014 Underwood New Music Readings.

In 1933, Alban Berg wrote the following in a letter to his wife: "They’ve been dancing and stamping all through the night…the whole town… drowned in carnival din, masks and confetti. And on top of that the news of the Reichstag fire. DANCING ON A VOLCANO!" The Reichstag fire was a pivotal event in the Nazi takeover of Germany. Berg’s ominous letter became the inspiration for the music of **_Dancing on Vesuvius_**. Much of *Dancing on Vesuvius* could be described as the perilous journey of a disguised waltz theme, which only briefly reveals itself as a true waltz. The rhythmic foreground is filled with life-affirming energy that, in a few instances, yields to brief flashbacks of quiet nostalgia. However, the kinetic surface masks a dark, underlying, turbulent disturbance that ultimately erupts like Vesuvius and completely engulfs the lyric waltz elements that appeared as a kind of musical metaphor for a benevolent and civilized society.

My clarinet concerto **_Auto '66_** is inspired by three classic cars built in 1966. Each car has a different national origin, which allowed me to draw from the native music for each. First up is the Lamborghini Miura which moves from the opening “coloratura” cadenza that quickly leads into a breathless Italian tarantella. This is then morphed into an Afro-Cuban rhumba, a similarly energetic Latin dance in a compound meter. Since all cars should be fast, the typical adagio middle movement is replaced with a brief scherzo that depicts the British Mini Cooper S. Two works of Gustav Holst serve as source material: the intermezzo from his First Suite in E-flat and *Mercury* from *The Planets*. Finally, the Pontiac GTO hosts a wide array of American music from gospel to electronica with a special nod to clarinetist Artie Shaw. This work is dedicated to my father who taught me to love cars and bands, and to my wife who taught me to love the clarinet.

**_Jie Ching_** is based on three selected Chinese Festivals—the Chinese New Year, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Qixi Festival (the Night of Sevens). The piece starts with a short introduction that derived from the main motive in the last section, then is followed by the section depicting the dangerous waves in the Dragon Boat Festival, continues with the celestial melodic ideas to depict the Zhi Nu and Niu Lang, and finally ends the piece with the celebrative Chinese New Year. As in nature, lives grow and cycle; continuous reproduction generates in an endless succession.

Inspired by a trip to Disneyland, **_Aerodynamics_** describes an imaginary flight on an open-air glider. In 2005, I went on a new ride at the California Adventure theme park called “Soarin' California,” during which I was suspended in the air with my legs dangling as if I were in a hang glider. I was immersed in imagery of landscapes that zoomed by as fans blew air at me to simulate incredible speed. I love high speeds and free flight, and *Aerodynamics* is my musical response to these visceral experiences. Musically, *Aerodynamics* is focused on the ebb and flow of fluid gestures, connected by a continuous stream of quickly repeated notes that represents the wind blowing at your face. Every line is echoed and mirrored so that a simple idea expands into a wash of sound. The listener may imagine taking flight throughout the piece, dipping and swooping as the shape of the music weaves its way from high to low and from small to large.
